### Day-1 - Introduction to RISC-V ISA and GNU compiler toolchain  
<details>
<summary>
Introduction to RISC-V basic keywords 
</summary>

- **RISC-V**: It is the medium of communicating with the computer. It is also known as Instruction Set Architecture(ISA). If we want to run a C-program on a computer, it is first converted into an assembly level language and further this is ocnverted into machine language i.e; binary which is the only language understood by the computer. We reuire another interface between the RISC-V and the computer, which is Hardware description language.  

- Inorder to run a software on a system/hardware, we will make use of a system called System Software. This system software mainlt consists of 3 blocks: OS, Compiler and Assembler.
